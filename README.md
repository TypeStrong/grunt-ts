grunt-ts
================
Written from scratch TypeScript compiler task for GruntJS. 
It differs from grunt-typescript which is another excellent [grunt plugin for typescript](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-typescript).

Following are the reasons why it was created. 

- This is written in [TypeScript](https://github.com/basarat/grunt-ts/blob/master/tasks/ts.ts)
- Gives a typescript development workflow in addition to simple file compilation. 
- Super simple to update to the [latest version of the typescript](https://github.com/basarat/grunt-ts/commit/ffede564f2b20bc4dc207cb1a30dc57db7c44fe5)

*If you know Grunt. Here is a quickstart full featured [Gruntfile](https://github.com/basarat/grunt-ts/blob/master/sample/Gruntfile.js)*

Following are some key features: 
======================

###Compiler support 
Supports the following compiler flags in both original format and camelCase (preferred):
 * --allowBool                   Allow 'bool' as a synonym for 'boolean'.
 * --allowImportModule           Allow 'module(...)' as a synonym for 'require(...)'.
 * --declaration                 Generates corresponding .d.ts file
 * --mapRoot LOCATION            Specifies the location where debugger should locate map files instead of generated locations.
 * --module KIND                 Specify module code generation: "commonjs" or "amd" (grunt-ts default)
 * --noImplicitAny               Warn on expressions and declarations with an implied 'any' type.
 * --noResolve                   Skip resolution and preprocessing
 * --removeComments              Do not emit comments to output (grunt-ts default)
 * --sourceMap                   Generates corresponding .map file (grunt-ts default)
 * --sourceRoot LOCATION         Specifies the location where debugger should locate TypeScript files instead of source locations.
 * --target VERSION              Specify ECMAScript target version: "ES3" (tsc default), or "ES5" (grunt-ts default)

Can also do js *file concatenation* using `--out`. Additionally supports an output directory for the generated
javascript using `--outDir` flag. 
For file ordering look at Javascript Generation below. 


###Reference file generation 
Can generate a reference.ts file for you which contains a reference to all your ts files.
This means you never need to cross reference files manually. Just reference `reference.ts` :) 


####Javascript generation and ordering
Also if you specify both an out js file via `out` && a reference file via `reference` 
it uses the generated reference file to *order the code in the generated javascript*. 

In your `reference.ts` file you can specify the order for the few files you care about
and leave the rest to be maintained by grunt-ts. 
E.g. in the following case the generated javascript for `someBaseClass.ts` is guaranteed to be at the top,
and the generated javascript for  `main.ts`is guaranteed to be at the bottom of the single merged js file. 
Everything between `grunt-start` and `grunt-end` is generated and maintained
for you. If there is no `grunt-start` section found, it is created for you. If `reference.ts` does not 
exist originally, it is created for you. 

```typescript

/// <reference path="someBaseClass.ts" />

// You can even put comments here and they are preserved

//grunt-start
/// <reference path="autoreference.ts" />
/// <reference path="someOtherFile.ts" />
//grunt-end


/// <reference path="main.ts" />
```

####Javscript generation Redirect
If you specify `outDir` all output javascript are redirected to this folder.
This helps keep your source folder clean.

####AMD / RequireJS support 
If you specify both `outDir` and `amdloader` option a Javascript requireJS loader file is created using the information
available from `reference.ts`. The file consists of three sections. 
* The initial ordered section. 
* A middle order independent section loaded asynchronously. 
* And a final ordered section.

e.g the following `reference` file

```typescript
/// <reference path="classa.ts" />

//grunt-start
/// <reference path="deep/classb.ts" />
/// <reference path="deep/classc.ts" />
//grunt-end

/// <reference path="deep/deeper/classd.ts" />
/// <reference path="app.ts" />
```

Corresponds to an `amdloader` (edited for readability): 

```typescript
// initial ordered files
define(function (require) {
  require(["./classa"],function () {
    // grunt-ts start
    require(["./deep/classb",                       
             "./deep/classc"],function () {
      // grunt-ts end
      // final ordered files
      require(["./deep/deeper/classd"],function () {  
        require(["./app"],function () {
          // final ordered file loaded
        });
      });
    });
  });
});
```

#####Advantage of using amdloader option
The following combination of circumstances are why you would use it instead of Compiler supported AMD. 

* You want to use RequireJS since you prefer to debug "js" files instead of "ts" files. 
This is useful in some cases and the most common way is using AMD
* However, File order doesn't matter to you, even when you have inter file depenendency (e.g. AngularJS runtime Dependency injection)

In such a case you can either create a `loader.js` manually or have grunt create it for you. 

**Further Explanation** If you use `export class Foo{}` at the root level of your file the only 
way to use the type information 
of Foo in another file is via an import statement `import foo = require('./potentially/long/path/to/Foo');` 
The ordering implied by this isn't necessary when using a runtime Dependency injection framework like AngularJS.
 Having a loader gives you the js debugging (+ async) advantages
of RequireJS without the overhead of constantly requesting via `import` to get the TypeScript type inference and 
worrying about file paths when they are not relevant. 

PS: your individual file SourceMaps will continue to work. So now you can debug individual "JS" or "TS" files :)


###Html 2 TypeScript support 
Can re-encode html files into typescript and makes them available as a variable. e.g.
a file called `test.html` containing
```html
<div> Some Content </div>
```
is compiled to a typescript file `test.html.ts` containing: 
```typescript
module test { export var html =  '<div> Some content </div>' } 
``` 
so that you can use use the variable `test.html` within your typescript to get the content of test.html 
as a string. The motivation is to remove http requests to load templates in various front end frameworks.

####Html 2 TypeScript usage in AngularJS 
This is great for putting variables in templateCache : http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$templateCache 
or even using the html string directly by setting it to the `template` properties (directives/views) instead of `templateUrl`

####Html 2 TypeScript usage in EmberJS
You can specify this string to the template on a view : http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.View.html 
Specifically: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9867375/390330

###Live file watching and building
Can watch a directory for you and recompile your typescript files when any typescript file changes, gets added, gets removed. 
This makes sure your project is always build ready :) 


npm install
======================

The npm package is available here : https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-ts

## Installation Documentation
Install nodejs. Then install grunt-cli using `npm install -g grunt-cli`. Next you can install `grunt` and `grunt-ts` by creating a `package.json`
file containing the following: 

```javascript
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "grunt" : "0.4.1",
    "grunt-ts" : "latest"
  }
}
```
and run `npm install` from the same directory. This will download both grunt and grunt-ts for you. 

## Configuration Documentation
Create a `Gruntfile.js`. Modify it to load grunt-ts by adding the following lines:

    module.exports = function (grunt) {
    
        // load the task 
        grunt.loadNpmTasks("grunt-ts");
        
        // Configure grunt here
    }

Then add some configuration for the plugin like so:

    grunt.initConfig({
        ...
        ts: {
            dev: {                                 // a particular target
                src: ["test/work/**/*.ts"],        // The source typescript files, http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#files
                html: ["test/work/**/*.tpl.html"], // The source html files, https://github.com/basarat/grunt-ts#html-2-typescript-support
                reference: "./test/reference.ts",  // If specified, generate this file that you can use for your reference management
                out: 'test/out.js',                // If specified, generate an out.js file which is the merged js file
                outDir: 'test/outputdirectory',    // If specified, the generate javascript files are placed here. Only works if out is not specified
                watch: 'test',                     // If specified, watches this directory for changes, and re-runs the current target
                options: {                         // use to override the default options, http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#options
                    target: 'es3',                 // 'es3' (default) | 'es5'
                    module: 'commonjs',            // 'amd' (default) | 'commonjs'
                    sourceMap: true,               // true (default) | false
                    declaration: false,            // true | false (default)
                    comments: false                // true | false (default)
                },
            },
            build: {                               // another target
                src: ["test/work/**/*.ts"],
                options: {                         // override the main options for this target
                    sourceMap: false,
                }
            },
        },
        ...
    });

I also recommend adding a default target you want to run in case you do not want to specify any arguments to grunt: 
```
grunt.registerTask("default", ["ts:dev"]);
```
    
You can see/grab an up-to-date sample grunt file here: https://github.com/basarat/grunt-ts/blob/master/sample/Gruntfile.js
   
### Different configurations per target   
Configuration options are per target. You can see how you can have one set of default options and then override
these selectively for a target (e.g `build` , `dev`, `staging` etc).
This is provided by grunt : http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#options

### Awesome file globs
You can do pretty fancy stuff with your src file selection.

# Contributing

## Building the project:

    tsc "./tasks/ts.ts" --sourcemap --module commonjs

## Running the tests:

With npm and grunt-cli installed, run the following from the root of the repository,

    grunt ts

Some tests expect failures and will be labelled.

We welcome new methods for writing automated tests that are a little less of a manual process.
